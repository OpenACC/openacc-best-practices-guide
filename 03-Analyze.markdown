Assess Application Performance
==============================
A variety of tools can be used to evaluate application performance and
which are available will depend on your development environment. From simple
application timers to graphical performance analyzers, the choice of
performance analysis tool is outside of the scope of this document. The purpose
of this section is to provide guidance on choosing important sections of code
for acceleration, which is independent of the profiling tools available. 

Throughout this guide, the NVIDIA Nsight Systems performance analysis tool which is provided with the CUDA toolkit, will be used for CPU profiling. When accelerator profiling is needed, the application will be run on an NVIDIA GPU and the NVIDIA Nsight Systems profiler will be used again.

Baseline Profiling
------------------
Before parallelizing an application with OpenACC the programmer must first
understand where time is currently being spent in the code. Routines and loops
that take up a significant percentage of the runtime are frequently referred to
as *hot spots* and will be the starting point for accelerating the application. 
A variety of tools exist for generating application profiles, such as gprof,
Vampir, Nsight Systems, and TAU. Selecting the specific tool that works 
best for a given application is outside of the scope of this document, but regardless 
of which tool or tools are used below are some important pieces of information
that will help guide the next steps in parallelizing the application.

* Application performance - How much time does the application take to run? How
  efficiently does the program use the computing resources? 
* Program hotspots - In which routines is the program spending most of its
  time? What is being done within these important routines? Focusing on the
  most time consuming parts of the application will yield the greatest results.
* Performance limiters - Within the identified hotspots, what's currently
  limiting the application performance? Some common limiters may be I/O, memory
  bandwidth, cache reuse, floating point performance, communication, etc.
  One way to evaluate the performance limiters of a given loop nest is to
  evaluate its *computational intensity*, which is a measure of how many
  operations are performed on a data element per load or store from memory. 
* Available parallelism - Examine the loops within the hotspots to understand
  how much work each loop nest performs. Do the loops iterate 10's, 100's,
  1000's of times (or more)? Do the loop iterations operate independently of
  each other? Look not only at the individual loops, but look a nest of loops
  to understand the bigger picture of the entire nest. 

Gathering baseline data like the above both helps inform the developer where to
focus efforts for the best results and provides a basis for comparing
performance throughout the rest of the process. It's important to choose input
that will realistically reflect how the application will be used once it has
been accelerated. It's tempting to use a known benchmark problem for profiling,
but frequently these benchmark problems use a reduced problem size or reduced
I/O, which may lead to incorrect assumptions about program performance. Many
developers also use the baseline profile to gather the expected output of the
application to use for verifying the correctness of the application as it is
accelerated.

Additional Profiling
--------------------
Through the process of porting and optimizing an application with OpenACC it's
necessary to gather additional profile data to guide the next steps in the
process. Some profiling tools, such as Nsight Systems and Vampir, support profiling on
CPUs and GPUs, while other tools, such as gprof, may
only support profiling on a particular platform. Additionally, some compilers
build their own profiling into the application, such is the case with the NVHPC
compiler, which supports setting the NVCOMPILER\_ACC\_TIME environment variable for 
gathering runtime information about the application. When developing on
offloading platforms, such as CPU + GPU platforms, it's generally important to
use a profiling tool throughout the development process that can evaluate both
time spent in computation and time spent performing PCIe data transfers. This
document will use NVIDIA Nsight Systems Profiler for performing this analysis, although
it is only available on NVIDIA platforms.

Case Study - Analysis
---------------------
To get a better understanding of the case study program we will use the
NVIDIA NSight Systems command line interface that comes as a part of the CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA HPC SDK. First,
it's necessary to build the executable. Remember to use the flags included in
the example below to ensure that additional information about how the
compiler optimized the program is displayed. The executable is built with the
following command:

~~~~
    $ nvc -fast -Minfo=all laplace2d.c
    GetTimer:
         21, include "timer.h"
              61, FMA (fused multiply-add) instruction(s) generated
    main:
         41, Loop not fused: function call before adjacent loop
             Loop unrolled 8 times
         49, StartTimer inlined, size=2 (inline) file laplace2d.c (37)
         52, FMA (fused multiply-add) instruction(s) generated
         58, Generated vector simd code for the loop containing reductions
         68, Memory copy idiom, loop replaced by call to __c_mcopy8
         79, GetTimer inlined, size=10 (inline) file laplace2d.c (54)
~~~~

Once the executable has been built, the `nsys` command will run the
executable and generate a profiling report that can be viewed offline in 
the NVIDIA Nsight Systems GUI

Once the data has been collected, and the .qdrep report has been generated,
it can be visualized using the Nsight Systems GUI. You must first copy the
report (report1.qdrep in the example above) to a machine that has graphical
capabilities and download the Nsight Systems interface. Next, you must open
the application and select your file via the file manager.

When we open the report in Nsight Systems, we see that the vast majority of
the time is spent in two routines: main and \_\_c\_mcopy8. A screenshot of
the initial screen for Nsight systems is shown in figure 2.1. Since the code
for this case study is completely within the main function of the program,
it's not surprising that nearly all of the time is spent in main, but in
larger applications it's likely that the time will be spent in several other
routines.

![Nsight initial profile window showing 81% of runtime in main and 17% in a memory copy routine.](images/ch2-nsight-initial.png)

Clicking into the main function we can see that nearly all of the runtime
within main comes from the loop that calculates the next value for A. This is
shown in figure 2.2. What is not obvious from the profiler output,
however, is that the time spent in the memory copy routine shown in the initial
screen is actually the second loop nest, which performs the array swap at the
end of each iteration. The compiler output shows above that the loop at line
68 was replaced by a memory copy, because doing so is more efficient than
copying each element individually. So what the profiler is really showing us
is that the major hotspots for our application are the loop nest that
calculate `Anew` from `A` and the loop nest that copies from `Anew` to `A`
for the next iteration, so we'll concentrate our efforts on these two loop
nests.

In the chapters that follow, we will optimize the loops identified in this
chapter as the hotspots within our example application.
