Optimize Loops
==============
Once data locality has been expressed, developers may wish to further tune the
code for the hardware of interest. It's important to understand that the more
loops are tuned for a particular type of hardware the less performance portable
the code becomes to other architecures. If you're generally running on one
particular accelerator, however, there may be some gains to be had by tuning
how the loops are mapped to the underlying hardware. 

It's tempting to begin tuning the loops before all of the data locality has
been expressed in the code. However, because data copies are frequently the limiter to
application performance on the current generation of accelerators the
performance impact of tuning a particular loop may be too difficult to measure
until data locality has been optimized. For this reason the best practice is to
wait to optimize particular loops until after all of the data locality has been
expressed in the code, reducing the data transfer time to a minimum.

Efficient Loop Ordering
-----------------------
Before changing the way OpenACC maps loops onto the hardware of interest, the
developer should examine the important loops to ensure that data arrays are
being accessed in an efficient manner. Most modern hardware, be it a CPU with
large caches and SIMD operations or a GPU with coalesced memory accesses and
SIMT operations, favor accessing arrays in a *stride 1* manner.  That is to say
that each loop iteration accesses consecutive memory addresses. This is
achieved by ensuring that the innermost loop of a loop nest iterates on the
fastest varying array dimension and each successive loop outward accesses the
next fastest varying dimension. Arranging loops in this increasing manner will
frequently improve cache efficiency and improve vectorization on most
architectures. 

OpenACC's 3 Levels of Parallelism
---------------------------------
OpenACC defines three levels of parallelism: *gang*, *worker*, and *vector*.
Additionally execution may be marked as being sequential (*seq*). Vector
parallelism has the finest granularity, with an individual instruction
operating on multiple pieces of data (much like *SIMD* parallelism on a modern
CPU or *SIMT* parallelism on a modern GPU). Vector operations are performed
with a particular *vector length*, indicating how many data elements may be
operated on with the same instruction. Gang parallelism is coarse-grained
parallelism, where gangs work independently of each other and may not
synchronize. Worker parallelism sits between vector and gang levels. A gang
consists of 1 or more workers, each of which operates on a vector of some
length.  Within a gang the OpenACC model exposes a *cache* memory, which can be
used by all workers and vectors within the gang, and it is legal to synchronize
within a gang, although OpenACC does not expose synchronization to the user.
Using these three levels of parallelism, plus sequential, a programmer can map
the parallelism in the code to any device. OpenACC does not require the
programmer to do this mapping explicitly, however. If the programmer chooses
not to explicitly map loops to the device of interest the compiler will
implicitly perform this mapping using what it knows about the target device.
This makes OpenACC highly portable, since the same code may be mapped to any
number of target devices. The more explicit mapping of parallelism the
programmer adds to the code, however, the less portable they make the code to
other architectures.

![OpenACC's Three Levels of Parallelism](images/levels_of_parallelism.png)

### Understanding OpenACC's Three Levels of Parallelism

The terms _gang_, _worker_, and _vector_ are foreign to most programmers, so
the meanings of these three levels of parallelism is often lost on new
OpenACC programmers. Here's a practical example to help understand these
three levels. Imagine that you need to paint your apartment. One person with
a roller and bucket of paint can be reasonably expected to paint a small
apartment in a few hours, maybe a day. For a small apartment, one painter is
probably enough to complete the job, but what about if I need to paint
every apartment in a large, multi-story building. In that case, it's a pretty
daunting task for one person to complete. There's a few tricks this painter
may try in order to work more quickly. One option is to work faster, moving
the roller across the wall as fast that their arm can manage. There's a
practical limit, however, to how fast a human being can actually use a paint
roller. Another option is to use a larger paint roller. Perhaps our painter
started with a 4 inch paint roller, so if they upgraded to an 8 inch roller,
they can cover twice as much wall space in the same amount of time. Why stop
there? Let's buy a 32 inch paint roller to cover even more wall
per stroke! Now we're going to start to run into different problems. For
instance, the painter's arm probably can't move as fast with a 32 inch roller
as an 8 inch, so there's no guarantee that this is actually faster.
Futhermore, wider rollers may result in awkward times when the painter has to
paint over a place they've already painted just so that the roller fits or
the wider roller may take more time to fill with paint. In either case,
there's a clear limit to how fast a single painter can get the job done, so
let's invite more painters.

Now assume I have 4 painters working on the job. If given independent areas
to paint, the job should get gone nearly 4 times faster, but at the cost of
getting 4 times as many rollers, paint pans, and cans of paint. This is
probably a small price to pay to get the job done nearly 4 times faster.
Large jobs require large crews, however, so let's increase the number of
painters again to 16. If each painter can work independently then the time it
takes to complete the painting will probably go down by another 4 times, but
now there may be some other inefficencies. For instance, it's probably
cheaper to buy large buckets of the paint, rather than small paint cans, so
we'll store those buckets in a central location where everyone can access
them. Now if a painter needs to refill their pan, they have to walk to get
their paint, which takes away from the time they're painting. Here's an idea,
let's organize our 16 painters into 4 groups of 4 painters, each of which has
their own bucket to share. Now so long as the painters within each crew is
working on jobs near the rest of the crew, the walk to get more paint is much
shorter, but the crews are still free to work completely independently of
each other.

In this analogy, there's 3 levels of parallelism, just like OpenACC. The
finest-grained level may not be completely obvious, but it's the size of the
roller. The width of the roller dictates how much wall the painter can paint
with each stroke. Wider rollers mean more wall per stroke, up to some limit.
Next there are parallel painters within each crew. These painters can work
mostly independently of each other, but occaisionally need to access their
shared paint bucket or coordinate the next, near-by piece of work to do.
Finally, there's our crews, which can work completely independently of each
other and might even work at different times (think, day shift and night
shift), representing the coarsest-grained parallelism in our hierarchy.

In OpenACC _gangs_ are like the work crews, they are completely independent
of each other and may operate in parallel or even at different times.
_Workers_ are the individual painters, they can operate on their own but may
also share resources with other _workers_ in the same _gang_. Finally the
paint roller represents the _vector_ where the width of the roller represents
the _vector length_. _Workers_ perform the same instruction on multiple
elements of data using _vector_ operations. So, _gangs_ consist of at least
one _worker_, which operates on a _vector_ of data.

Mapping Parallelism to the Hardware
-----------------------------------
With some understanding of how the underlying accelerator hardware works it's
possible to inform the compiler how it should map the loop iterations into
parallelism on the hardware. It's worth restating that the more detail the
compiler is given about how to map the parallelism onto a particular
accelerator the less performance portable the code will be. For instance, 
setting a fixed vector length may enhance performance on one processor and
hinder performance on another or fixing the number of gangs used to execute on
a loop may result in limiting the performance on processors with a larger 
degree of parallelism.

As discussed earlier in this guide, the `loop` directive is intended to give the
compiler additional information about the next loop in the code. In addition to
the clauses shown before, which were intended to ensure correctness, the
clauses below inform the compiler which level of parallelism should be used to
for the given loop.

* Gang clause - partition the loop across gangs
* Worker clause - partition the loop across workers
* Vector clause - vectorize the loop
* Seq clause - do not partition this loop, run it sequentially instead

These directives may also be combined on a particular loop. For example, a
`gang vector` loop would be partitioned across gangs, each of which with 1
worker implicitly, and then vectorized. The OpenACC specification enforces that
the outermost loop must be a gang loop, the innermost parallel loop must be
a vector loop, and a worker loop may appear in between. A sequential loop may
appear at any level.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang
    for ( i=0; i<N; i++)
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for ( j=0; j<M; j++)
        ;
~~~~

--

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}
    !$acc parallel loop gang
    do j=1,M
      !$acc loop vector
      do i=1,N
~~~~

Informing the compiler where to partition the loops is just one part of
optimizing the loops. The programmer may additionally tell the compiler the
specific number of gangs, workers, or the vector length to use for the loops.
This specific mapping is achieved slightly differently when using the `kernels`
directive or the `parallel` directive. In the case of the `kernels` directive,
the `gang`, `worker`, and `vector` clauses accept an integer parameter that
will optionally inform the compiler how to partition that level of parallelism.
For example, `vector(128)` informs the compiler to use a vector length of 128
for the loop. 

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc kernels
    {
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for ( i=0; i<N; i++)
      #pragma acc loop vector(128)
      for ( j=0; j<M; j++)
        ;
    }
~~~~

---

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}
    !$acc kernels
    !$acc loop gang
    do j=1,M
      !$acc loop vector(128)
      do i=1,N

    !$acc end kernels
~~~~

When using the `parallel` directive, the information is presented
on the `parallel` directive itself, rather than on each individual loop, in the
form of the `num_gangs`, `num_workers`, and `vector_length` clauses to the
`parallel` directive.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector_length(128)
    for ( i=0; i<N; i++)
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for ( j=0; j<M; j++)
        ;
~~~~

---

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}
    !$acc parallel loop gang vector_length(128)
    do j=1,M
      !$acc loop vector
      do i=1,N
~~~~

Since these mappings will vary between different accelerator, the `loop`
directive accepts a `device_type` clause, which will inform the compiler that
these clauses only apply to a particular device type. Clauses after a
`device_type` clause up until either the next `device_type` or the end of the
directive will apply only to the specified device. Clauses that appear before
all `device_type` clauses are considered default values, which will be used if
they are not overridden by a later clause. For example, the code below
specifies that a vector length of 128 should be used on devices of type
`acc_device_nvidia` or a vector length of 256 should be used on devices of
type `acc_device_radeon`. The compiler will choose a default vector length for
all other device types.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector \
                device_type(acc_device_nvidia) vector_length(128) \
                device_type(acc_device_radeon) vector_length(256)
    for (i=0; i<N; i++)
    {
      y[i] = 2.0f * x[i] + y[i];
    }
~~~~

Collapse Clause
---------------
When a code contains tightly nested loops it is frequently beneficial to
*collapse* these loops into a single loop. Collapsing loops means that two loops
of trip counts N and M respectively will be automatically turned into a single
loop with a trip count of N times M. By collapsing two or more parallel loops into a
single loop the compiler has an increased amount of parallelism to use when
mapping the code to the device. On highly parallel architectures, such as GPUs,
this can result in improved performance. Additionally, if a loop lacked
sufficient parallelism for the hardware by itself, collapsing it with another
loop multiplies the available parallelism. This is especially beneficial on
vector loops, since some hardware types will require longer vector lengths to
achieve high performance than others. Collapsing gang loops may also be beneficial
if it allows for generating a greater number of gangs for highly-parallel processors.
The code below demonstrates how to use the collapse directive.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang collapse(2)
    for(ie = 0; ie < nelemd; ie++) {
      for(q = 0; q < qsize; q++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector collapse(3)
        for(k = 0; k < nlev; k++) {
          for(j = 0; j < np; j++) {
            for(i = 0; i < np; i++) {
              qtmp = elem[ie].state.qdp[i][j][k][q][n0_qdp];
              vs1tmp = vstar[i][j][k][0][ie] * elem[ie].metdet[i][j] * qtmp;
              vs2tmp = vstar[i][j][k][1][ie] * elem[ie].metdet[i]]j] * qtmp;
              gv[i][j][k][0] = (dinv[i][j][0][0][ie] * vs1tmp + dinv[i][j][0][1][ie] * vs2tmp);
              gv[i][j][k][1] = (dinv[i][j][1][0][ie] * vs1tmp + dinv[i][j][1][1][ie] * vs2tmp);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
~~~~

---

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}    
    ! $acc parallel loop gang collapse (2)
    do ie = 1 , nelemd
      do q = 1 , qsize
        ! $acc loop vector collapse (3)
        do k = 1 , nlev
          do j = 1 , np
            do i = 1 , np
              qtmp = elem (ie )% state % qdp (i,j,k,q, n0_qdp )
              vs1tmp = vstar (i,j,k ,1, ie) * elem (ie )% metdet (i,j) * qtmp
              vs2tmp = vstar (i,j,k ,2, ie) * elem (ie )% metdet (i,j) * qtmp
              gv(i,j,k ,1) = ( dinv (i,j ,1 ,1 , ie )* vs1tmp + dinv (i,j ,1 ,2, ie )* vs2tmp )
              gv(i,j,k ,2) = ( dinv (i,j ,2 ,1 , ie )* vs1tmp + dinv (i,j ,2 ,2, ie )* vs2tmp )
            enddo
          enddo
        enddo
      enddo
    enddo
~~~~

The above code is an excerpt from a real application where collapsing loops
extended the parallelism available to be exploited. On line 1, the two
outermost loops are collapsed together to make it possible to generate *gangs*
across the iterations of both loops, thus making the possible number of gangs
`nelemd` x `qsize` rather than just `nelemd`. The collapse at line 4 collapses
together 3 small loops to increase the possible *vector length*, as none of the
loops iterate for enough trips to create a reasonable vector length on the
target accelerator. How much this optimization will speed-up the code will vary
according to the application and the target accelerator, but it's not uncommon
to see large speed-ups by using collapse on loop nests.

Routine Parallelism
-------------------
A previous chapter introduced the `routine` directive for calling functions and
subroutines from OpenACC parallel regions. In that chapter it was assumed that
the routine would be called from each loop iteration, therefore requiring a
`routine seq` directive. In some cases, the routine itself may contain
parallelism that must be mapped to the device. In these cases, the `routine`
directive may have a `gang`, `worker`, or `vector` clause instead of `seq` to
inform the compiler that the routine will contain the specified level of
parallelism. This can be thought of as _reserving_ a particular level of 
parallelism for the loops in that routine. This is so that when the compiler
then encounters the call site of the affected routine, it will then know how
it can parallelize the code to use the routine. It's important to note that 
if an `acc routine` calls another routine, that routine must also have an
`acc routine` directive. At this time the OpenACC specification does not
allow for specifying multiple possible levels of parallelism on a single
routine.

Case Study - Optimize Loops
---------------------------
This case study will focus on a different algorithm than the previous chapters.
When a compiler has sufficient information about loops to make informed
decisions, it's frequently difficult to improve the performance of a given
parallel loop by more than a few percent. In some cases, the code lacks the
information necessary for the compiler to make informed optimization decisions.
In these cases, it's often possible for a developer to optimize the parallel
loops significantly by informing the compiler how to decompose and distribute
the loops to the hardware.

The code used in this section implements a sparse, matrix-vector product (SpMV)
operation. This means that a matrix and a vector will be multiplied together,
but the matrix has very few elements that are not zero (it is *sparse*),
meaning that calculating these values is unnecessary. The matrix is stored in a
Compress Sparse Row (CSR) format. In CSR the sparse array, which may contain a
significant number of cells whose value is zero, thus wasting a significant
amount of memory, is stored using three, smaller arrays: one containing the
non-zero values from the matrix, a second that describes where in a given row
these non-zero elements would reside, and a third describing the columns in
which the data would reside. The code for this exercise is below.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for(int i=0;i<num_rows;i++) {
      double sum=0;
      int row_start=row_offsets[i];
      int row_end=row_offsets[i+1];
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
      for(int j=row_start;j<row_end;j++) {
        unsigned int Acol=cols[j];
        double Acoef=Acoefs[j];
        double xcoef=xcoefs[Acol];
        sum+=Acoef*xcoef;
      }
      ycoefs[i]=sum;
    }
~~~~

---

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}
    !$acc parallel loop
    do i=1,a%num_rows
      tmpsum = 0.0d0
      row_start = arow_offsets(i)
      row_end   = arow_offsets(i+1)-1
      !$acc loop reduction(+:tmpsum)
      do j=row_start,row_end
        acol = acols(j)
        acoef = acoefs(j)
        xcoef = x(acol)
        tmpsum = tmpsum + acoef*xcoef
      enddo
      y(i) = tmpsum
    enddo
~~~~

One important thing to note about this code is that the compiler is unable to
determine how many non-zeros each row will contain and use that information in
order to schedule the loops. The developer knows, however, that the number of
non-zero elements per row is very small and this detail will be key to
achieving high performance. 

***NOTE: Because this case study features optimization techniques, it is
necessary to perform optimizations that may be beneficial on one hardware, but
not on others. This case study was performed using the NVHPC 20.11 compiler on an
NVIDIA Volta V100 GPU. These same techniques may apply on other architectures,
particularly those similar to NVIDIA GPUs, but it will be necessary to make
certain optimization decisions based on the particular accelerator in use.***

In examining the compiler feedback from the code shown below, I know that the
compiler has chosen to use a vector length of 256 on the innermost loop. I
could have also obtained this information from a runtime profile of the
application. 

~~~~
    matvec(const matrix &, const vector &, const vector &):
          3, Generating Tesla code
              4, #pragma acc loop gang /* blockIdx.x */
              9, #pragma acc loop vector(256) /* threadIdx.x */

          3, Generating present(ycoefs[:],xcoefs[:],row_offsets[:],Acoefs[:],cols[:])
          9, Loop is parallelizable
~~~~

Based on my knowledge of the matrix, I know that this is
significantly larger than the typical number of non-zeros per row, so many of
the *vector lanes* on the accelerator will be wasted because there's not
sufficient work for them. The first thing to try in order to improve
performance is to adjust the vector length used on the innermost loop. I happen
to know that the compiler I'm using will restrict me to using multiples of the
*warp size* (the minimum SIMT execution size on NVIDIA GPUs) of this processor,
which is 32. This detail will vary according to the accelerator of choice.
Below is the modified code using a vector length of 32.


~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop vector_length(32)
    for(int i=0;i<num_rows;i++) {
      double sum=0;

      int row_end=row_offsets[i+1];
      #pragma acc loop vector reduction(+:sum)
      for(int j=row_start;j<row_end;j++) {
        unsigned int Acol=cols[j];
        double Acoef=Acoefs[j];
        double xcoef=xcoefs[Acol];
        sum+=Acoef*xcoef;
      }
      ycoefs[i]=sum;
    }
~~~~

~~~~ {.fortran .numberLines}
    !$acc parallel loop vector_length(32)
    do i=1,a%num_rows

      row_end   = arow_offsets(i+1)-1
      !$acc loop vector reduction(+:tmpsum)
      do j=row_start,row_end
        acol = acols(j)
        acoef = acoefs(j)
        xcoef = x(acol)
        tmpsum = tmpsum + acoef*xcoef
      enddo
      y(i) = tmpsum
    enddo
~~~~

Notice that I have now explicitly informed the compiler that the innermost loop
should be a vector loop, to ensure that the compiler will map the parallelism
exactly how I wish. I can try different vector lengths to find the optimal
value for my accelerator by modifying the `vector_length` clause. Below is a graph
showing the relative speed-up of varying the vector length
compared to the compiler-selected value.

![Relative speed-up from varying vector_length from the default value of 128](images/spmv_speedup_vector_length.png)

Notice that the best performance comes from the smallest vector length. Again,
this is because the number of non-zeros per row is very small, so a small
vector length results in fewer wasted compute resources. On the particular chip
I'm using, the smallest possible vector length, 32, achieves the best possible
performance. On this particular accelerator, I also know that the hardware will
not perform efficiently at this vector length unless we can identify further
parallelism another way. In this case, we can use the *worker* level of
parallelism to fill each *gang* with more of these short vectors. Below is the
modified code.

~~~~ {.c .numberLines}
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang worker num_workers(4) vector_length(32)
    for(int i=0;i<num_rows;i++) {
      double sum=0;

      int row_end=row_offsets[i+1];

        double Acoef=Acoefs[j];
        double xcoef=xcoefs[Acol];
        sum+=Acoef*xcoef;
      }
      ycoefs[i]=sum;
    }

      row_end   = arow_offsets(i+1)-1

      do j=row_start,row_end
        acol = acols(j)

        xcoef = x(acol)
        tmpsum = tmpsum + acoef*xcoef
      enddo
      y(i) = tmpsum
    enddo
~~~~

In this version of the code, I've explicitly mapped the outermost loop to both
gang and worker parallelism and will vary the number of workers using the
`num_workers` clause. The results follow.

![Speed-up from varying number of workers for a vector length of 32.](images/spmv_speedup_num_workers.png)

On this particular hardware, the best performance comes from a vector length of
32 and 4 workers, which is similar to the simpler loop with a default vector length of 128.
In this case, we
observed a 2.5X speed-up from decreasing the vector length and another 1.26X
speed-up from varying the number of workers within each gang, resulting in an
overall 3.15X performance improvement from the untuned OpenACC code.

***Best Practice:*** Although not shown in order to save space, it's generally
best to use the `device_type` clause whenever specifying the sorts of
optimizations demonstrated in this section, because these clauses will likely
differ from accelerator to accelerator. By using the `device_type` clause it's
possible to provide this information only on accelerators where the
optimizations apply and allow the compiler to make its own decisions on other
architectures. The OpenACC specification specifically suggests `nvidia`,
`radeon`, and `host` as three common device type strings.
